 [0.00 - 14.12] One of the hallmarks of living in a technologically advanced society is even the little details of
[14.12 - 19.60] life that see mundane end up being astonishing. Like the fact that it takes five gallons of
[19.60 - 24.32] water to produce a walnut or that half the plastic that's ever been made has been made
[24.32 - 31.04] in the past 15 years. My favorite of these examples is what it takes to keep a room, room temperature.
[31.04 - 36.88] Allow me to explain. Heating is generally done by combusting a fossil fuel. So first we have to
[36.88 - 41.00] find the fuel. Unfortunately it tends to be buried more than a kilometer under the Earth's
[41.00 - 46.24] surface and all too often in inconvenient places like the Arctic Circle, nations in conflict,
[46.24 - 51.92] or under the bottom of the ocean. And then there's the fact that the substance takes 60 to 600
[51.92 - 57.36] million years to form from dead plankton. So there's that issue. We drill these incredibly
[57.36 - 63.60] deep holes to get it. Then we pipe it, truck it, and ship it in tankers across the world to refineries,
[63.60 - 68.64] which are these incredibly expensive industrial facilities that take in crude oil and gas,
[68.64 - 73.76] which are just a bunch of different hydrocarbon molecules in order to sort those molecules
[73.76 - 79.60] into refined products. Refined natural gas is then delivered to homes and businesses via an
[79.60 - 86.40] invisible interstate highway system millions of miles long. It's invisible because it's underground.
[86.40 - 92.48] There is so much pipeline in this system that entire steel mills have been built only to produce
[92.48 - 99.20] pipeline for this system. And because there are millions of miles of gas getting pumped beneath us
[99.20 - 105.20] at high pressure at all times, engineers send these intelligent robots called smart pigs through
[105.28 - 111.36] the pipelines to check for safety defects. Doing this is called paging the pipeline. Yeah, that's a
[111.36 - 117.60] real thing. But even with these precautions, there are accidents. In 2010, the San Bruno natural gas
[117.60 - 124.16] pipeline exploded in California. Eight people died. Eye witnesses reported the blast with like a
[124.16 - 131.20] wall of fire a thousand feet tall. More recently in 2018, excess pressure and natural gas pipelines
[131.20 - 136.56] and Massachusetts resulted in explosions that killed somebody and forced 50,000 others from their
[136.56 - 142.32] homes. But you know, despite all of this, we're actually jealous of people who live close enough
[142.32 - 148.48] to these insane pipelines to get gas into their homes because everyone else is stuck with even
[148.48 - 154.48] worse options like fuel oil and propane. These fuels don't have pipelines in place for delivery,
[154.48 - 159.76] so instead, hens of thousands of trucks go from home to home in neighborhoods throughout the country,
[159.76 - 164.64] pumping these fuels into tanks and homeowners' basements and yards. And regardless of what
[164.64 - 170.08] heating fuel you use, gas, propane, or oil, you better have a carbon monoxide detector, so your
[170.08 - 174.88] heating system doesn't accidentally kill you in the night because hundreds of Americans die in
[174.88 - 182.00] exactly that way each year. So, that's the system we have today. Safe to say it has some downsides.
[182.56 - 187.52] Don't get me wrong, it's a marvel of human ingenuity, but with some pretty serious drawbacks.
[187.52 - 192.56] And the rigourmourol of conventional heating feels even more over the top when you consider that
[192.56 - 199.60] every home is already sitting right on top of a vast reservoir of renewable energy, geothermal energy.
[199.60 - 204.08] Let's talk about geothermal energy. Starting a few feet under the Earth's surface,
[204.08 - 209.76] the ground is a wash and thermal energy. This is why caves and wine sellers, they never get too hot
[209.76 - 215.44] or too cold. They're just bathed in this low-grade heat. Geothermal heating systems draw on this heat
[215.44 - 220.32] using what are called ground loops, which are just simple plastic pipes buried under the yard.
[220.32 - 224.32] These ground loops are then connected to a heat pump that sits inside the home,
[224.32 - 229.92] typically where a furnace once was. More and more homeowners are choosing geothermal over fuel-based
[229.92 - 235.20] options. I see this shift up close every day because I co-founded a company to create a new kind
[235.20 - 241.52] of ground-up utility by making it as easy and inexpensive as possible to switch from conventional
[241.92 - 246.32] to geothermal. We've done this by creating a service where homeowners can fill out a phone on our
[246.32 - 250.72] website, we design a geothermal heating system for them, and then we install that system using
[250.72 - 255.76] for this built tools and equipment. Once the installation is done, that home will have moved on
[255.76 - 260.32] from fossil heating forever because those ground loops they'll last as long as the home itself.
[260.32 - 266.32] As each home switches over, a new kind of utility is taking hold. A distributed utility made up
[266.32 - 272.32] of homes exchanging renewable energy with the ground. This new infrastructure is simple,
[272.32 - 277.68] local, and inexpensive to operate, and it represents a permanent and wholesale shift away from
[277.68 - 282.96] fossil fuels. The groundwork is being laid so to speak, for the idea that maybe we don't need to
[282.96 - 287.92] destroy the world in order to keep our rooms at a comfortable temperature. Let's leave the Arctic
[287.92 - 293.52] Circle and the Sea floor alone, bypass their fineries in the pipelines, and stop worrying that our
[293.52 - 298.48] families will accidentally be poisoned in the night. Instead, let's use the massive amounts of
[298.48 - 306.48] energy that are already right there for the taking. Right beneath every building on Earth. Thank you.
